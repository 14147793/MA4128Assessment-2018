## Introduction

A *Geomtric Brownian Motion* (GBM) is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows
a Brownian motion (also called a Wiener process) with drift.[1] It is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic
differential equation (SDE); in particular, it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Black–Scholes model.

Geometric Brownian motion is used to model stock prices in the Black–Scholes model and is the most widely used model of stock price behavior.

Some of the arguments for using GBM to model stock prices are:

*The expected returns of GBM are independent of the value of the process (stock price), which agrees with what we would expect in reality.
*A GBM process only assumes positive values, just like real stock prices.
*A GBM process shows the same kind of 'roughness' in its paths as we see in real stock prices.
*Calculations with GBM processes are relatively easy.
