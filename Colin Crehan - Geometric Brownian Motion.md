## Introduction

A *Geomtric Brownian Motion* (GBM) is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows
a Brownian motion (also called a Wiener process) with drift.[1] It is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic
differential equation (SDE); in particular, it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Black–Scholes model.

Geometric Brownian motion is used to model stock prices in the Black–Scholes model and is the most widely used model of stock price behavior.

Some of the arguments for using GBM to model stock prices are:

* The expected returns of GBM are independent of the value of the process (stock price), which agrees with what we would expect in reality.
* A GBM process only assumes positive values, just like real stock prices.
* A GBM process shows the same kind of 'roughness' in its paths as we see in real stock prices.
* Calculations with GBM processes are relatively easy.

## History

In 1944 Ito introduced
his calculus and a variant of the Brownian motion which is the geometric
Brownian motion . Since the 1950s mathematicians began to show interest
in the modeling of stock market prices. Bachelier original proposal that the price
changes are Gaussian distributed was replaced to a model in which stock prices
are log-normal distributed. In 1973, Black, Scholes and Merton.
used the geometric Brownian motion to construct a theory for determining the
price of stock options. This theory constitutes nowadays the cornerstone of
mathematical finance.
