## Introduction

A *Geomtric Brownian Motion* (GBM) is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows
a Brownian motion (also called a Wiener process) with drift.[1] It is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic
differential equation (SDE); in particular, it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Blackâ€“Scholes model.

A stochastic process St is said to follow a GBM if it satisfies the following stochastic differential equation (SDE):

{\displaystyle dS_{t}=\mu S_{t}\,dt+\sigma S_{t}\,dW_{t}} dS_{t}=\mu S_{t}\,dt+\sigma S_{t}\,dW_{t}
where {\displaystyle W_{t}} W_{t} is a Wiener process or Brownian motion, and {\displaystyle \mu } \mu  ('the percentage drift') and {\displaystyle \sigma } \sigma  ('the percentage volatility') are constants.

The former is used to model deterministic trends, while the latter term is often used to model a set of unpredictable events occurring during this motion
