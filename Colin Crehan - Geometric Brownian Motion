## Introduction

A *Geomtric Brownian Motion* (GBM) is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows
a Brownian motion (also called a Wiener process) with drift.[1] It is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic
differential equation (SDE); in particular, it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Blackâ€“Scholes model.

> Functional data is multivariate data with an ordering on the dimensions
