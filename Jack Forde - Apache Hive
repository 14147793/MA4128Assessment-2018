## Apache Hive
Apache Hive is considered the standard instrument for interactive SQL queries over petabytes of data in Hadoop. Hadoop is an open source, Java-based programming framework that supports the processing and storage of extremely large data sets in a distributed computing environment. It is part of the Apache project. Hadoop was built to organize and store massive amounts of data with a "schema on read" architecture. This enables the data to be used by different groups who might want to get different insights.
Data analysts use Hive to query, summarize, explore and analyze that data, then turn it into actionable business insight. Hive has three main functions: 
*data summarization
*query
*analysis.
