### xts
## Description
This function is used internally in the subsetting mechanism of xts. The function is unexported,
though documented for use with xts subsetting.
## Details
This function replicates most of the ISO standard for expressing time and time-based ranges in a
universally accepted way.
The basic idea is to create the endpoints of a range, given a string representation. These endpoints
are aligned in POSIXct time to the zero second of the day at the beginning, and the 59.9999th
second of the 59th minute of the 23rd hour of the final day.
For dates prior to the epoch (1970-01-01) the ending time is aligned to the 59.0000 second. This is
due to a bug/feature in the R implementation of asPOSIXct and mktime0 at the C-source level. This
limits the precision of ranges prior to 1970 to 1 minute granularity with the current xts workaround.
Recurring times over multiple days may be specified using the T notation. See the examples for
details
