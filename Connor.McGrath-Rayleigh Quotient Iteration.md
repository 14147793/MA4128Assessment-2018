## Introduction
Automatic milking is the milking of dairy animals, especially of dairy cattle, without human labour. Automatic milking systems (AMS), also called voluntary milking systems (VMS), were developed in the late 20th century. They have been commercially available since the early 1990s. The core of such systems that allows complete automation of the milking process is a type of agricultural robot. Automated milking is therefore also called robotic milking.Common systems rely on the use of computers and special herd management software.
## Algorithm
The algorithm is very similar to inverse iteration, but replaces the estimated eigenvalue at the end of each iteration with the Rayleigh quotient. Begin by choosing some value ![mu](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu_%7B0%7D) as an initial eigenvalue guess for the Hermitian matrix ***A*** An initial vector ![b0](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7Bb_%7B0%7D%7D) must also be supplied as initial eigenvector guess.

Calculate the next approximation of the eigenvector ![bi](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7Bb_%7Bi&plus;1%7D%7D) by
