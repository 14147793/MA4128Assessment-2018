## About
This brief essay explores the use of sabermetrics, a revolutionary approach to sports analytics primarily used in baseball allowing small, low-budget teams to compete with the giants of the game.

Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game is a book by Michael Lewis, published in 2003, about the Oakland Athletics baseball team and
its general manager Billy Beane. Its focus is the team's analytical, evidence-based, sabermetric approach to assembling a competitive
baseball team, despite Oakland's disadvantaged revenue situation. A film based on the book starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill was released
in 2011.
## Background
The central premise of Moneyball is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the front office) over the past century is subjective and often flawed. Statistics such as stolen bases, runs batted in, and batting average, typically used to gauge players, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game and the statistics available at that time.
Before sabermetrics was introduced to baseball, teams were dependent on the skills of their scouts to find and evaluate players. Scouts
are those who are experienced in the sport, usually having been involved as players or coaches. The book argues that the Oakland A's'
front office took advantage of more analytical gauges of player performance to field a team that could better compete against richer
competitors in Major League Baseball (MLB). Rigorous statistical analysis had demonstrated that on-base percentage and slugging
percentage are better indicators of offensive success, and the A's became convinced that these qualities were cheaper to obtain on the
open market than more historically valued qualities such as speed and contact. These observations often flew in the face of conventional
baseball wisdom and the beliefs of many baseball scouts and executives.
