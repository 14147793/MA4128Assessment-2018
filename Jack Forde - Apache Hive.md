## Apache Hive
Apache Hive is considered the standard instrument for interactive SQL queries over petabytes of data in Hadoop. Hadoop is an open source, Java-based programming framework that supports the processing and storage of extremely large data sets in a distributed computing environment. It is part of the Apache project. Hadoop was built to organize and store massive amounts of data with a "schema on read" architecture. This enables the data to be used by different groups who might want to get different insights.

Data analysts use Hive to query, summarize, explore and analyze that data. Hive is used on top of Hadoop and supports analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop's HDFS and other compatible file systems. Apache Hive has three main functions: 
* data summarization
* query
* analysis.

## Advantages to Using Hive
Universal
There is not one single Hive format in which the data must be. Hive supports tab separated and comma separated text files along with others. The Hive data warehouse software facilitates reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL. This makes it easy to use as most data scientists will be familiar with SQL. Hives SQL can also be extended by with user defined functions.
Fast	
Interactive response times, even over huge datasets
Scalable and Extensible	
Hive is designed to maximise scalability as data variety and volume grows, more commodity machines can be added, without a corresponding reduction in performance
