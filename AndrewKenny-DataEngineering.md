Data engineers are the plumbers building a data pipeline, while data scientists are the painters and storytellers giving meaning to an otherwise static entity. Simply put, data engineers clean, prepare and optimize data for consumption.

Data engineering is inherently a multidisciplinary field, because of the number of technologies involved: visualization, data analysis, knowledge engineering, perhaps databases, and courses the subject matter of the application. (Sumathi and Sivanandam 2006)

Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis (DataScience 2018). For all the work that data scientists do to answer questions using large sets of information, there have to be mechanisms for collecting and validating that information (DataScience 2018). In order for that work to ultimately have any value, there also have to be mechanisms for applying it to real-world operations in some way (DataScience 2018). Those are both engineering tasks: the application of science to practical, functioning systems (DataScience 2018).

Data engineers focus on the applications and harvesting of big data. Their role doesnâ€™t include a great deal of analysis or experimental design (DataScience 2018). Instead, they are out where the rubber meets the road (literally, in the case of self-driving vehicles), creating interfaces and mechanisms for the flow and access of information (DataScience 2018). They may be experts in:

1. System architecture
2. Programming
3. Database design and configuration
4. Interface and sensor configuration
