*In a numbers game, whoever has the most information usually ends up winning. That has largely been the thinking in the gambling industry, with the house having the better odds in any game that is played. Gambling is already all about the numbers, so it should probably come as no surprise that the rise of big data has caught industry leadersâ€™ attention.*

## What is Big Data in Sports Betting?
The first people to adopt big data in the gambling world were the bookmakers -- those that live by the odds they establish. Getting as much information as possible is a crucial aspect of the business, so the moment new techniques designed to analyze and transmit that data cropped up, adopting it was a simple decision to make. The traditional data warehousing strategy was unneeded, especially since data needed to be accessed almost in the moment. Betting firms quickly utilized big data analytics as a way to manage their businesses and stay on top of the game.

At the same time, other companies saw the potential of actually placing the odds more in favor of the gamers themselves. Big data services quickly appeared that were designed to empower gamblers, giving them more information and helping them strategize more effectively. One such site that made full use of big data was SharkScope, which collects data from millions of online poker games every day. Players can track all their statistics on the site as a way to improve and increase their chances of winning. SharkScope quickly discovered that as the company gathered more data, querying would take longer, so they adopted new big data tools allowing for faster querying and use of ad hoc data to provide a much desired service for gamblers.
