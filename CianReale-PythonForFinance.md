 ## What is Python?
 Python is an object oriented, high-level programming language, It is a simple, but very powerful language. It is heavily used in
 scientific computing, as well as many other fields including game development. Python is easy to learn and its simple syntax makes it
 readable and efficient. It is used by beginner programmers as well as highly skilled expert developers across wide range of fields. Python has major applications in the world of finance. The financial industry has adopted Python at a tremendous rate recently, with some of the largest investment banks and hedge funds using it to build core trading and risk management systems. Python is characterized by the following features:

1. ___Open source___: Python and the majority of supporting libraries and tools available are open source and generally come with quite flexible and open licenses.
2. ___Interpreted___: The reference CPython implementation is an interpreter of the language that translates Python code at runtime to executable byte code.
3. ___Multiparadigm___: Python supports different programming and implementation paradigms, such as object orientation and imperative, functional, or procedural programming.
4. ___Multipurpose___: Python can be used for rapid, interactive code development as well as for building large applications; it can be used for low-level systems operations as well as for high-level analytics tasks.
5. ___Cross-platform___: Python is available for the most important operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and Mac OS; it is used to build desktop as well as web applications; it can be used on the largest clusters and most powerful servers as well as on such small devices as the Raspberry Pi.
6. ___Dynamically typed___: Types in Python are in general inferred during runtime and not statically declared as in most compiled languages.
7. ___Indentation aware___: In contrast to the majority of other programming languages, Python uses indentation for marking code blocks instead of parentheses, brackets, or semicolons.
8. ___Garbage collecting___: Python has automated garbage collection, avoiding the need for the programmer to manage memory.

## History
Guido Van Rossum is the creator of Python. In the late 1980s, Van Rossum began work on Python at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherland. In an interview with Bill Venners, Van Rossum explained how he had worked on a team building a language called ABC in the early 1980s. He claims that this expeience had a major role to play in the inception and realization of Python. The first version of Python was released in 1991.The following can be considered milestones in the development of Python:

1. Python 0.9.0 released in **1991** (first release)

2. Python 1.0 released in **1994**
 
3. Python 2.0 released in **2000**

4. Python 2.6 released in **2008**

5. Python 2.7 released in **2010**

6. Python 3.0 released in **2008**

7. Python 3.3 released in **2010**

8. Python 3.4 released in **2014**
