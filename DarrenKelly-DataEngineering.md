Data engineering is the multi-disciplinary practice of engineering computing systems, computer software, or extracting information partly through the analysis of data. This following essay will briefly go through what data engineers do.

A data engineer enable data scientists to do their jobs more effectively. A data engineer gathers and collects the data, stores it, does batch processing or real-time processing on it, and serves it via an API (Application Program Interface) to a data scientist who can easily query it.

There are many Big Data tools on the market that perform each of these steps, and it is important that the choice of using a particular tool can be defended. A good data engineer has extensive knowledge of databases and best engineering prectices. These include handling and logging erros, monitoring the system, building human-fault-tolerant pipelines, understanding what is necessary to scale up, addressing continuous integration, knowledge of database administration, maintaining data cleaning, and ensuring a deterministic pipeline.
