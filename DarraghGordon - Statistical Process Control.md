**Statistical Process Control**

 Statistical process control (SPC) is the application of statistical methods to the monitoring and control of a process to ensure that it operates at its full potential to produce conforming product. 

## History of Statistical Process Control

The concepts of Statistical Process Control (SPC) were initially developed by **Dr. Walter Shewhart** of Bell Laboratories in the 1920's, and were expanded upon by **Dr. W. Edwards Deming**, who introduced SPC to Japanese industry after WWII. After early successful adoption by Japanese firms, Statistical Process Control has now been incorporated by organizations around the world as a primary tool to improve product quality by reducing process variation.
Dr. Shewhart identified two sources of process variation: **Chance** variation that is inherent in process, and stable over time, and **Assignable**, or **Uncontrolled** variation, which is unstable over time - the result of specific events outside the system. Dr. Deming relabeled chance variation as **Common Cause** variation, and assignable variation as **Special Cause** variation.
Based on experience with many types of process data, and supported by the laws of statistics and probability, Dr. Shewhart devised control charts used to plot data over time and identify both Common Cause variation and Special Cause variation.

## What is SPC

SPC is method of measuring and controlling quality by monitoring the manufacturing process. Quality data is collected in the form of product or process measurements or readings from various machines or instrumentation. The data is collected and used to evaluate, monitor and control a process. SPC is an effective method to drive continuous improvement. By monitoring and controlling a process, we can assure that it operates at its fullest potential at all times. If a process is not operationg to its fullest potential, this can be seen from the data which has been collected, from this data the required changes may be made to a process or a machine to improve the output of the process/machine.

## Why Use SPC?

The plain fact is that when a process is within statistical control, its output is indiscernible from random variation: the kind of variation which one gets from tossing coins, throwing dice, or shuffling cards. Whether or not the process is in control, the numbers will go up, the numbers will go down; indeed, occasionally we shall get a number that is the highest or the lowest for some time. Of course we shall: how could it be otherwise? The question is - do these individual occurrences mean anything important? When the process is out of control, the answer will sometimes be yes. When the process is in control, the answer is no.
So the main response to the question "Why SPC?" therefore this: It guides us to the type of action that is appropriate for trying to improve the functioning of a process. Should we react to individual results from the process (which is only sensible, if such a result is signalled by a control chart as being due to a special cause) or should we instead be going for change to the process itself, guided by cumulated evidence from its output (which is only sensible if the process is in control)?

The key to any process improvement program is the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle described by Walter Shewhart

*Plan* involves using SPC tools to help you identify problems and possible causes.
*Do* involves making changes to correct or improve the situation.
*Study* involves examining the effect of the changes (with the help of control charts).
*Act* involves, if the result is successful, standardizing the changes and then working on further improvements or, if the outcome is not successful, implementing other corrective actions.
