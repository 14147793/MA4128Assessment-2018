**Statistical Process Control**

 Statistical process control (SPC) is the application of statistical methods to the monitoring and control of a process to ensure that it operates at its full potential to produce conforming product. 

**History of Statistical Process Control**

The concepts of Statistical Process Control (SPC) were initially developed by **Dr. Walter Shewhart** of Bell Laboratories in the 1920's, and were expanded upon by **Dr. W. Edwards Deming**, who introduced SPC to Japanese industry after WWII. After early successful adoption by Japanese firms, Statistical Process Control has now been incorporated by organizations around the world as a primary tool to improve product quality by reducing process variation.
Dr. Shewhart identified two sources of process variation: **Chance** variation that is inherent in process, and stable over time, and **Assignable**, or **Uncontrolled** variation, which is unstable over time - the result of specific events outside the system. Dr. Deming relabeled chance variation as **Common Cause** variation, and assignable variation as **Special Cause** variation.
Based on experience with many types of process data, and supported by the laws of statistics and probability, Dr. Shewhart devised control charts used to plot data over time and identify both Common Cause variation and Special Cause variation.

**What is SPC**

SPC is method of measuring and controlling quality by monitoring the manufacturing process. Quality data is collected in the form of product or process measurements or readings from various machines or instrumentation. The data is collected and used to evaluate, monitor and control a process. SPC is an effective method to drive continuous improvement. By monitoring and controlling a process, we can assure that it operates at its fullest potential at all times. If a process is not operationg to its fullest potential, this can be seen from the data which has been collected, from this data the required changes may be made to a process or a machine to improve the output of the process/machine.
