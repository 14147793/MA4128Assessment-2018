### ** What is Tensorflow **
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It was originally developed by Google. It is the second machine learning framework that Google developed and used to design build and train deep learning models. Tensorflow can be used to complete numericial computations. Any statistical programme can be used for this, the difference with tensorflow is that it completes these computations with data flow graphs. In these graphs, nodes represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the data. these are usually multidimensional arrays or tensors. A tensor is a  mathematical object analogous to but more general than a vector, represented by an array of components that are functions of the coordinates of a space. Simply speaking, a tensor is a mathematical representation of a physical entity that may be characterized by magnitude and multiple directions. The thing that makes tensors so special is the combination of components and basis vectors. basis vectors transform one way between reference frames and components transform in just such a way as to keep the combination between components and basis vectors the same. 
### **How Tensorflow is used **
Tensorflow is used widely by a range of different mulinational companies including the likes of Snapchat, Ebay and Twitter.
