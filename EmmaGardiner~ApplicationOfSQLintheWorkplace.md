SQL is simply a basic programming language, which is used for organising information in a database and to send and recienve information about the database. It has necessary applications for large companies, but some medium and small companies have been found to used SQL in recent year.SQL is very useful for business-to-customer companies and also for companies that specialise in delivering a product to its customers.

SQL is compatible with most high level programming languages and thus it is often used to help other programes to interact with its database. SQL is seen as a necessary skill for optimaization in many workplaces.

Database management

SQL’s sole design is to manage databases, and that’s the biggest benefit it can have for your company. SQL can run complex queries that search for specific pieces of information based on listed criteria. For example, if you had a database of employee payments and you wanted to just see the amount paid to employees in the marketing division, SQL could run a query that would only pull information about those individuals.

Little coding required
-----------------------
SQL is rather easy to work with itself, even though setting it up can sometimes be confusing. SQL only has seven different commands, which is a lot simpler than most programming languages. Of course, these commands can be used in a variety of ways so it does get a little more complicated, but not much. Compared to other languages, SQL is one of the least code dependent.

Used by large companies
--------------------------
One of the largest companies in the world, Microsoft, use SQL. Microsoft uses it in Open Database Connectivity, SQL Server, and ActiveX Data Objects. Many large companies use this Microsoft SQL server, such as:
*    Nigel Frank International Limited [Companies Website](https://www.nigelfrank.com)
*    Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. [Companies Website](https://www.jackhenry.com)
*    Eagle Creek Software Services, Inc.[Companies Website](https://www.eaglecrk.com)
*    ARUP Laboratories [Companies Website](https://www.aruplab.com)
*    PEOPLE TECH GROUP [Companies Website](https://www.peopletechgroup.com)


You’ll also find that a majority of software development companies out there will use SQL with their programmess in order to manage databases efficiently.

Relational database managment
------------------------------

Firstly, what is a relational database? A relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables.
These relational databases are designed to have information from one table that relates to another table. This if often through a primary key. An example of this is would be two tables with an ID value. SQL makes it easy to relate these tables through primary keys in order for them to retrieve information from several tables at once which is then displayed in a very easy to read mannor.

An example of this would be, say you have two tables. The first table contains students details, while the second table contacins classes. Using SQL, you can join elements from both tables, such as student IDs, to find which students are taking what classes.


Why companies choose to use SQL
--------------------------------
So why do companies choose to use SQL sever for machine learning model management over others? It's safe to say that SQL simply makes life easier. It doesn't take a long time for you programmer to set up and it's easy to maintain. As for database managment, SQL is an organised system that protects your database from accidental manilipulation. 


However more technical reasons for choosing are:
*   SQL servers store analytical models created by expert data scientists, making it easy for reuse. These models can be scaled and then used by many other applications. 
*   Another reason SQL is chose is because SQL reduces the difficulty of working with models such as deploy models and managing models metadata as well as offering version contol and security. 
*   SQl also lowers barriers to adopting analytical models and enables faster development if intelligent application with rapid iteration. 
*   However, most importantly, SQL enables anyone to participate in the modelling process.
