# Qualitative vs Quantitative Data
## Introduction
There exists a fundamental distinction between two types of data: qualitative and quantitative. The way we typically define them, we call data 'quantitative' if it is in numerical form and 'qualitative' if it is not. 
Quantitative data is information about quantities; that is, information that can be measured and written down with numbers. Some examples of quantitative data are your height, your shoe size, and the length of your fingernails. Speaking of which, it might be time to call Guinness. You've got to be close to breaking the record.Qualitative data is information about qualities; information that can't actually be measured. Some examples of qualitative data are the softness of your skin, the grace with which you run, and the color of your eyes. However, try telling Photoshop you can't measure color with numbers.

Here's a quick look at the difference between qualitative and quantitative data. 
* The age of your car. (Quantitative.)  
* The number of hairs on your knuckle. (Quantitative.)  
* The softness of a cat. (Qualitative.)  
* The color of the sky. (Qualitative.)  
* The number of pennies in your pocket. (Quantitative.)

Remember, if we're measuring a quantity, we're making a statement about quantitative data. If we're describing qualities, we're making a statement about qualitative data. Keep your L's and N's together and it shouldn't be too tough to keep straight.
## Cases for Qualitative Analytics
So when would you use qualitative analytics? While there are many examples when you would, here are three use cases: 
### 1) Finding out why a customer decided to do business with you
Understanding what prompted a customer to choose your business over a competitor’s will help you pinpoint what your competitive advantage is and how to sell your product or service. Qualitative analytics can come in handy in this case: ask questions like ‘Why did you sign up?’ and ‘Why did you visit this page?' in order to collect data that will help you. Make sure you word the question so it’s open-ended and can generate more authentic responses from customers.
### 2) Finding out what customer’s perception of your value proposition is
Sometimes you think you know what value your product or service gives to customers. But once you ask customers what value they think you provide, you might be surprised to hear their responses. This can change the way you package your service or how you sell your product.
### 3) Fishing for copy language
The language your customers use is really golden. When you’re looking for best ways to write your pay-per-click (PPC) ad copy, you’ll want to first understand how customers write about your product or service. You can use your customer’s own words in your ad copy!

## Cases for Quantitative Analytics
So when would you use quantitative analytics?
### 1) Understanding how customers are using the product
You can use quantitative analytics to understand how customers use your product or service. This will give you data points that back up what value you think you give to customers based on what features they use most often.  You can find out not just who the habitual users are, but how often they use certain features and which features they use. 
### 2) Basic traffic reporting
You can find out where most of your website traffic is coming from by using quantitative analytics. Through Google Analytics, you can figure out where the organic search requests come from and which specific media channels are bringing in the most people.
### 3) Conversion funnel
Use quantitative analytics when you’re trying to identify where customers abandon your conversion funnel. You can use this data to create a strategy to improve certain steps of the funnel so you can increase the overall conversion rate. l
