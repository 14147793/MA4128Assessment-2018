# Apache Kafka
## What is it?
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. A streaming platform typically lets you publish and subscribe to streams of records, store streams of records in a fault-tolerant way and process streams of records as they occur. Kafka was initially developed by LinkedIn before being further developed by the Apache Software Foundation.
## How it works?
Kafka maintains feeds of messages in topics. Producers write data to topics and consumers read from topics. Since Kafka is a distributed system, topics are partitioned and replicated across multiple nodes.
## What it's used for?
