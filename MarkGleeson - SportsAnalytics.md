# **What is sports analytics?**

There are two key aspects of sports analytics - on-field and off-field analytics. On-field analytics deals with improving the on-field performance of teams and players. It digs deep into aspects such as game tactics and player fitness. Off-field analytics deals with the business side of sports. For this purpose of this exercise, we will deal solely with on-field analytics. 



Sports all over the world have developed hugely over the past years. Training methods are more specific, so-called weaknesses in opposition players are highlighted and coaches have furthered their knowledge of how to get the most from their players. This development is primarily as a result of the use of data analytics in sport. 

## **History**

The rise of this began when the Oakland A’s baseball team used data and statistics to completely turn around their ball club in the early 2000s. It also brought the concept of sports analytics into the limelight. The squad was built completely from statistics and personal views or beliefs were dismissed. Perceived ‘weaker’ players were drafted into the team based on their stats from previous seasons. This change is depicted in the world-famous film – Moneyball.
