## Background
Outliers in statistics are values which deviate largely from other observations in a given sample. Outliers can occur for a number of
reasons, including experimental error or even random variation. Outliers in statistics, when not dealt with correctly can have detrimental
effect on the analysis.

### Application
One major reson outlier identification is important is when testing fornormality of data. Tests for normality in data may falsely reject 
normality due to the presence of outliers. For this reason it is firstly important to graphically visualize the data to see if by inspection
any outliers can be identified.
